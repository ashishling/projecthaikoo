# üêæ PRD: AI Pet Portrait Generator Web App  
**Working Title:** Haikoo
**Owner:** Ashish Lingamneni
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 25 June 2025

## 1. Objective

Build a web-based application that allows users to log in, upload images of their pets, and generate Gen-AI styled portraits using OpenAI's GPT-based image generation model. Users can view previous generations, delete them, and are limited to a free tier with 3 generations and 30-day image retention.

---

## 2. Key User Flows

### üßç Unauthenticated Flow
- User lands on a public landing page
- Sees demo or sample gallery
- Clicks "Sign In" to begin

### üë§ Authenticated Flow
- User logs in via Supabase (email or social auth)
- Redirected to a dashboard/home
  - View previous generations
  - Upload image and generate new portrait
  - Delete images
  - Logout

---

## 3. Core Features

### ‚úÖ Front-End
- Landing page with demo and sample gallery
- Login/signup modal via Supabase Auth
- Signed-in home page with:
  - "Generate New Portrait" interface
  - "Past Generations" gallery
  - Delete button per image
  - Logout button

### ‚úÖ Back-End
- Image generation API (calls OpenAI GPT image model)
- Supabase database for tracking users and image metadata
- Supabase storage for hosting actual images

| Field        | Type       | Description                          |
|--------------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| id           | UUID       | Primary key                          |
| user_id      | UUID       | Linked to Supabase Auth user         |
| prompt       | TEXT       | Style prompt used for generation     |
| image_url    | TEXT       | Link to image in Supabase Storage    |
| created_at   | TIMESTAMP  | Auto-generated                       |
| deleted      | BOOLEAN    | Soft delete flag (optional)          |

### Supabase Storage
- Bucket: `generated-images`
- Path: `user_id/filename.png`

## 7. Architecture Overview

- **Client:** Next.js + Supabase SDK  
- **API Gateway (Serverless Function):**
  - Receives request with user input + photo
  - Uses OpenAI GPT image model to generate output
  - Uploads result to Supabase Storage
  - Inserts metadata into `generations` table

- **Supabase Storage:** Stores all user image assets  
- **Supabase DB:** Tracks generation metadata per user  
- **Supabase Auth:** Manages login/session

## 8. Clarified Design Decisions & Open Questions

### ‚úÖ Gen-AI Model
We will use **OpenAI's GPT-based image generation model** (`gpt-image-1`).

**Example Code:**
```ts
import OpenAI from "openai";
import fs from "fs";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const result = await openai.images.generate({
    model: "gpt-image-1",
    prompt: "A cartoon portrait of a golden retriever in superhero costume"
});

const image_base64 = result.data[0].b64_json;
const image_bytes = Buffer.from(image_base64, "base64");
fs.writeFileSync("output.png", image_bytes);
